        <li><b>1919</b> On July 20, 1919, Edmund Percival Hillary was born in Auckland, New Zealand. His father was
          Percival Augustus Hillary; he went by "Percy." His mother was Gertrude Hillary (maiden name Clark).</li>
        <li><b>1920</b> Hillary’s family moved to Tuakau, a smaller town south of Auckland. Edmund's father had been
          allocated eight acres of land as a returned soldier of the 15th Regiment.</li>
        <li><b>1935</b> At the age of 16, Hillary went on school trip to Mount Ruapehu and is exposed to climbing for
          the first time. He is quoted as saying that he "wanted to see the world." He went on to attend Auckland
          University College, but dropped out after two years.</li>
        <li><b>1939</b> Hillary completed his first major climb. He reached the peak of Mount Ollivier in the Canterbury
          Region of New Zealand with his friend Tenzing Norgay. The summit of Mount Ollivier has an elevation of 6,342
          feet (1,933 meters).</li>
        <li><b>1948</b> Hillary climbed to the south ridge of Aoraki to Mount Cook, New Zealand’s highest peak. The
          official height is currently listed as 12,218 feet (3,724 meters), but the South Peak is only 11,788 feet
          (3,593 meters).</li>
        <li><b>1949</b> Hillary went to Switzerland to climb in the Swiss Alps. It was there that he ascended Jungfrau
          (4,158 meters or 13,642 feet).</li>
        <li><b>1951</b> Hillary participated in a reconnaissance expedition to Mount Everest.
        </li>
        <li><b>1952</b> Hillary was part of the British team that tried unsuccessfully to climb the Cho Oyu, the sixth
          highest mountain in the world at 26,864 feet above sea level.</li>
        <li><b>1953</b> On May 29, Hillary and Norgay became the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest. It
          was this same year that Hillary was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and became Sir Edmund Hillary. He also married
          Louise Mary Rose in 1953.</li>
